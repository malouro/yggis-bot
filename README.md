## Feature List

Anyone installing or running Yggis should be able to do the following:

- Run the Discord bot locally and with minimal initial configuration. (setup & run, that's it!)
- Be able to configure the bot in a multitude of robust ways, for your own personal use & on your own server(s) of choice with (relative) ease.
- Logging of all events
- Commands!
  - LFG
  - StreamLink

... Granted, a number of these are a work in progress and probably not implemented or implemented fully yet. Check out the Yggis project board for more information on the progress & status of these features.

## Requirements

- Node.js 10 LTS
- A Discord application/bot token
- Yarn (if contributing or working locally)


## What is Yggis?
